      <description>Wow, where to even begin? It&amp;rsquo;s now been just over a month since my last entry, which means I essentially have only two more weeks here at Cambridge. And believe me when I say that what an adventure it has been!
  Inside King&amp;#39;s College, Cambridge. AKA home.  As a bit of background, our time here is split into two halves called modules. My module 1 consisted of constant classes, readings, homework, and papers.</description>

      <description>After practically living _in _Petra for a month and a half, intimately getting to know the sites daily and being constantly surrounded by 2,000 year-old buildings and inscriptions, I thought seeing Athens and then Jerusalem wouldn&amp;rsquo;t make much of an impact on me. Boy was I wrong.
  Excited? Better believe it.  My day in Athens was a blast. I essentially just had an 11-hour layover, which was the perfect amount of time to visit the Acropolis and then the Acropolis Museum.</description>
