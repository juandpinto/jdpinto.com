      <description>Wow, where to even begin? It&amp;rsquo;s now been just over a month since my last entry, which means I essentially have only two more weeks here at Cambridge. And believe me when I say that what an adventure it has been!
  Inside King&amp;#39;s College, Cambridge. AKA home.  As a bit of background, our time here is split into two halves called modules. My module 1 consisted of constant classes, readings, homework, and papers.</description>

      <description>I never quite realized how much hard work a dedicated blogger must put into his or her posts and photos. This is especially true when traveling in areas where free internet is hard to come by. For me it has meant, more than anything, lack of sleep. Such as right now when I am up in my hotel room in Amman, running on my minimal sleep from the last few days, and unwilling to go to bed until at least something is published.</description>
