      <description>This week I relocated from working at the temple on the mountaintop to the tomb in the valley. It&amp;rsquo;s my official transition to the second and last part of my adventure as an archaeologist this summer. Having been here for three of the six weeks meant it was time to rotate crews and excavation sites, so I am now working under a different site director in a very different place.</description>

      <description>It is absolutely unbelievable that I&amp;rsquo;m actually in this place. Not only that I’m here, but that I’m doing what I’m here to do.
I came to Petra for the first time almost two years ago as part of the BYU Jerusalem Center study abroad. I remember the preparation we received prior to our Jordan trip, and how we were told that we would want to see as much of Petra as we possibly could during our single day here.</description>
