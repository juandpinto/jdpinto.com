      <description>After practically living _in _Petra for a month and a half, intimately getting to know the sites daily and being constantly surrounded by 2,000 year-old buildings and inscriptions, I thought seeing Athens and then Jerusalem wouldn&amp;rsquo;t make much of an impact on me. Boy was I wrong.
  Excited? Better believe it.  My day in Athens was a blast. I essentially just had an 11-hour layover, which was the perfect amount of time to visit the Acropolis and then the Acropolis Museum.</description>

      <description>In only a few hours I am to get on a plane and begin the next phase of my adventures this summer. The last six weeks have blown by much faster than I can believe. But, c&amp;rsquo;est la vie I suppose.
I don&amp;rsquo;t really have much to say at this point, though maybe it&amp;rsquo;s just because I&amp;rsquo;m so tired. We spent the day driving to Amman and relaxing in our hotel rooms, but though my body is exhausted, my mind is too excited to sleep.</description>

      <description>If you’ve ever seen _Lawrence of Arabia_ then you know all about the incredible beauty that can be found in the deserts of the Arab world. One such beautiful place, Wadi Rum, was the location for most of the filming of the movie, and this weekend I got to hike and camp out in that very place.
We were told about the chance to go to Wadi Rum while we were still in the States, preparing for our trip, and of course I could not possibly pass up the chance of something like that.</description>

      <title>Reading abroad</title>

      <description>Time stops for no one. Almost three of our six weeks here are now gone, which means soon we’ll be rotating sites so next week I’ll start working with Dr. Johnson in his beloved tomb.
It’s strange how quick we are to become used to daily experiences—no matter how amazing they are—and to begin to take them for granted without even noticing. Sometimes I catch myself speeding through everything without taking the time to marvel again at the beauty in the sights, sounds, and smells that surround me.</description>

      <title>Life of an archaeologist</title>
      <link>https://juandpinto.com/blog/life-of-an-archaeologist/</link>

      <description>When I agreed to come on this trip, much of my enthusiasm came from the thought that I would get to learn about archaeology the very best way possible: by becoming an archaeologist myself for six weeks. That initial excitement has slowly grown over the last year, accumulating more and more as I&amp;rsquo;ve prepared, until becoming an unstoppable avalanche of anticipation for what my adventures here would entail.
Though I&amp;rsquo;m not an archaeology major, Ancient Near Eastern Studies owes a lot to archaeology.</description>

      <title>Break days</title>

      <description>Our weekends here are essentially Friday and Saturday, since Sundays are normal workdays just like the rest of the week—heavy, heavy workdays. I&amp;rsquo;ll go more into what a typical workday as an archaeologist in the field is like some other time. Right now, I just want to talk about our break days this week.
    Friday was our day to go exploring some castles in the area. After a little lecture on the Crusades and the forts the Crusaders built around here, we went out on our field trips.</description>

      <title>Petra, wonder of the world</title>

      <description>It is absolutely unbelievable that I&amp;rsquo;m actually in this place. Not only that I’m here, but that I’m doing what I’m here to do.
I came to Petra for the first time almost two years ago as part of the BYU Jerusalem Center study abroad. I remember the preparation we received prior to our Jordan trip, and how we were told that we would want to see as much of Petra as we possibly could during our single day here.</description>

      <description>I never quite realized how much hard work a dedicated blogger must put into his or her posts and photos. This is especially true when traveling in areas where free internet is hard to come by. For me it has meant, more than anything, lack of sleep. Such as right now when I am up in my hotel room in Amman, running on my minimal sleep from the last few days, and unwilling to go to bed until at least something is published.</description>

      <title>T-minus hours</title>

      <description>You know that feeling when you suddenly realize that maybe you should&amp;rsquo;ve just played it safe with a boring summer at home instead of being crazy enough to buy plane tickets that will take you all over the world? No? Good. Me neither.
Am I nervous? Sure. But the excitement of the prospect of fulfilling so many dreams in the next four short months far outweighs any other emotions going through me right now.</description>

      <title>Dead Sea Scrolls and Moab</title>

      <description>Classes are now over for the semester, and I&amp;rsquo;m supposed to be getting ready for finals. Yet it (unsurprisingly) wasn&amp;rsquo;t hard to convince myself that writing a blog post is almost as important as studying. Reading days are for relaxing after all—right?
So how did I decide to spend the last weekend before the end of classes? A legitimate question indeed. Well I received an email last week asking for someone willing to help out at the Dead Sea Scrolls Conference at the Leonardo Museum in Salt Lake City over the weekend.</description>

      <title>Adventure is out there</title>

      <description>Welcome to the ramblings of a simple man, with a simple life, but who dreams big and is not afraid to try new things. I decided that I needed a place to post all of my present and future adventures, and thus you are now seeing the result of that idea. Why the awkward blog name, you ask? I&amp;rsquo;ll leave that for you to figure out.
Without giving my life story, here is all the background information you may want to know (or not): I was born in Cali, Colombia, where I grew up until I was eight.</description>
