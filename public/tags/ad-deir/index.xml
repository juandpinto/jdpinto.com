      <description>This week I relocated from working at the temple on the mountaintop to the tomb in the valley. It&amp;rsquo;s my official transition to the second and last part of my adventure as an archaeologist this summer. Having been here for three of the six weeks meant it was time to rotate crews and excavation sites, so I am now working under a different site director in a very different place.</description>

      <description>When I agreed to come on this trip, much of my enthusiasm came from the thought that I would get to learn about archaeology the very best way possible: by becoming an archaeologist myself for six weeks.Â That initial excitement has slowly grown over the last year, accumulating more and more as I&amp;rsquo;ve prepared, until becoming an unstoppable avalanche of anticipation for what my adventures here would entail.
Though I&amp;rsquo;m not an archaeology major, Ancient Near Eastern Studies owes a lot to archaeology.</description>
