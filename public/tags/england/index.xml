      <description>Now that my Cambridge experience has come to an end, it&amp;rsquo;s time to reflect on my two months spent there. But first, a quick recap of my adventures of the last week.
Northern England I spent Tuesday through Thursday morning way up north. Some future in-laws have been living up there for the last two years, and they welcomed me with open arms. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure what to expect—not being familiar with the towns and sights to see up there—but wanted to go up anyway to spend time with them.</description>

      <description>My first week at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry has been a tremendous success. I&amp;rsquo;ve got the _wingardium leviosa _spell down pretty well, and have almost mastered the expelliarmus spell. Next up: avada kedavra.
But in all seriousness. This place is awesome.
  Feeling fancy at King&amp;#39;s Dining Hall.    Across the River Cam, King&amp;#39;s College.  My arrival at Cambridge—the town—was uneventful. I took the train from Stansted Airport and made it in about an hour.</description>
