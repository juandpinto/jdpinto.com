      <description>I spent most of last week at a Fulbright training in Amman, Jordan. All the Fulbright English Teaching Assistants from the entire MENA region (Middle East, North Africa) were brought there for an intense few days of training on language acquisition theories, teaching techniques, and lesson planning. And intense it was!
    We had three entire days of trainings, discussions, workshops, and even mock classes that we planned and then presented to the rest of the group.</description>

      <description>Wow, where to even begin? It&amp;rsquo;s now been just over a month since my last entry, which means I essentially have only two more weeks here at Cambridge. And believe me when I say that what an adventure it has been!
  Inside King&amp;#39;s College, Cambridge. AKA home.  As a bit of background, our time here is split into two halves called modules. My module 1 consisted of constant classes, readings, homework, and papers.</description>
