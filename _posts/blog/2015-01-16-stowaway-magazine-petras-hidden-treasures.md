I was interviewed by the great [Natalie Campbell](http://nataliecherie.weebly.com) for this wonderful article published on Stowaway Magazine. It describes some of the highlights of my time excavating in Petra last summer. Natalie also does a good job capturing a snapshot of what it's like to be a student archaeologist.
