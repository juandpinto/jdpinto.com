This site is very much a work in progress. I have many IndieWeb protocols I hope to implement in the near future, especially WebMentions. I also want to import many of my past ramblings from my previous blog (last used in 2014!) and maybe even from Facebook and Twitter.

Still, I think it important to give a basic overview of what I plan to do here. This post will address two questions:

1. How is this site organized?
2. What will I blog about?


## How is this site organized?

My plan is to have this site organized into three main areas: academic information, blog, and microblog. Academic information includes things like my CV, current projects, data and code repositories, etc. This is my main reason for a having a site at all.

The blog and microblog sections are meant to replace my dependence on social media silos such as Facebook and Twitter. Though I still plan to syndicate anything I do here to those and other platforms, my posts and thoughts will reside on my own site first and foremost. The blog section is for longer articles, while my microblog is (theoretically) restricted to shorter posts, pictures, and check-insâ€”think Twitter or short Facebook posts. My reason for separating these into two separate sections is to make it easier to find an organized set of more though-out articles in the midst of a flood of short posts.

At least this is how I plan to have things organized for now. All of it is subject to change in the future.


## What will I blog about?

Great question. Seeing as my life consists of two main areas, everything I post will fall into one or the other.

First and foremost is my family life. I really lucked out here. I have the most wonderful wife and children I could ask for, and they are by far the best aspect of my life. I've only been married for three and a half years, but we've already had some crazy adventures as a family. In fact, we're spending this academic year in Israel, so you can bet I'll be posting a bit about our time here.

In an effort to make the site more focused and less scattered with unrelated posts, I've decided to delegate most posts in this topic to my microblog. Let me explain.

This site, apart from serving as a sort of business card and hosting my CV, is really two blogs in one: (1) a full blog of longer, more thought-out posts, and (2) a microblog akin to Twitter. The microblog part of my site uses the wonderful Micro.blog
