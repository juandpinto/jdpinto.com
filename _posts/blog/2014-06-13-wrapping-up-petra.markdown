In only a few hours I am to get on a plane and begin the next phase of my adventures this summer. The last six weeks have blown by much faster than I can believe. But, c'est la vie I suppose.

I don't really have much to say at this point, though maybe it's just because I'm so tired. We spent the day driving to Amman and relaxing in our hotel rooms, but though my body is exhausted, my mind is too excited to sleep.

Really, this entire experience has been one long learning process. From learning about the technical aspects of archaeology, to finding out how much I love this place, to getting used to new peoples and customs, learning how to avoid getting frustrated while working hard in the sun, and learning how to work well in a team. Though I don't plan on pursuing archaeology per se (I prefer different aspects of Ancient Near Eastern Studies), I have no doubt that my last few weeks here will shape much of my future life and career. I realized just how much I love this kind of work and its contributions to the areas I focus on. And again, I realized more than ever just how much I love the Middle East.

So, without further ramblings, here are just a few pictures from our most recent adventures. Stay tuned for everything soon to come!
