Welcome to the ramblings of a simple man, with a simple life, but who dreams big and is not afraid to try new things. I decided that I needed a place to post all of my present and future adventures, and thus you are now seeing the result of that idea. Why the awkward blog name, you ask? I'll leave that for you to figure out.

Without giving my life story, here is all the background information you may want to know (or not): I was born in Cali, Colombia, where I grew up until I was eight. At that point my family moved to New Jersey, where they're still living. I served a two-year proselyting mission for [The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints](http://www.mormon.org) in Las Vegas, Nevada, which changed my life. Since then I've been studying Ancient Near Eastern Studies at Brigham Young University, and like to consider myself an aspiring Hebrew scholar. Yes, I am very much a [geek](http://www.wikihow.com/Tell-the-Difference-Between-Nerds-and-Geeks)—and proud of it. But don't let that fool you. I dream of traveling the world and meeting people from very different backgrounds, as my summer plans below will attest.

My plans for this summer began as an unexpected invitation to participate in an archaeological excavation at one of my favorite places in the world: Petra, Jordan. From there things quickly escalated, and my current plans are as follows: Paris, Petra, Athens, Jerusalem, Cambridge ([PKP Study Abroad](http://www.pem.cam.ac.uk/international-programmes/summer-programmes/pembroke-kings-programme/)), and possibly Switzerland. I am blessed enough to have some very generous sources of funding for some of my adventures. In fact, if you follow me along for the ride, you will soon see that I am constantly blessed so much more than I deserve. But not just me—[daily miracles](http://thedailymiracle.tumblr.com) are out there for anyone willing to see them.

Before my travels begin however, and I do hope you join me for at least some of them, I still have the rest of this semester to get through. Not to drudge through, mind you—only to get through joyfully.
