Oh, hello there! That's right, I'm just another hipster academic with a blog. But what's so bad about that?

I'm an aspiring teacher and researcher, currently in a bit of limbo as I prepare to teach in Israel this coming school year as a Fulbright English Teaching Assistant. I recently received my Master's in Middle Eastern Languages and Culture (my emphasis being Hebrew Applied Linguistics) from the University of Texas at Austin, and I will be applying to PhD programs later this year.

My background in language learning and teaching, as well as my fascination with computers and big data, are a big part of what make meâ€”well, me. The areas of research that most interest me are found precisely at this interception of Second Language Acquisition and Data Science. I'm convinced that much of the data we now collect through our rapidly-expanding efforts to teach and learn languages online have yet to be tapped into for research purposes. I use my data mining and analysis skills for this very purpose. In doing so, I hope to better understand how modern technologies can be used in the teaching and learning of foreign languages.

I also like to consider myself an advocate of open science / open data / open source software / open educational resources / whatever you want to call it. Research needs to be as accessible and reproducible as possible, and I do what I can in my own spheres of influence to further that aim. You can check out my personal open repositories, along with my latest projects, at [my GitHub account](https://github.com/juandpinto).

When I'm not working on my personal projects, sharpening my Python / statistical analysis skills, or reading the latest publications in the field, you'll usually find me spending quality time with my wife and two children. We're excited to begin our next adventure in Israel soon.

# About this site

This site serves a central hub for the goings-on of my life. Primarily, I use it so like-minded academics can contact me easily and learn more about my latest projects. I'm always looking for fellow collaborators, so feel free to [reach out](mailto: jdpinto1@gmail.com). Here you'll also always find the latest version of my [CV](/cv/).

But aside from basic information, this site hosts my two blogs: [one](/posts/) with posts about academic / technological topics, and [one](/inquisitive-bean/) with ramblings about my adventures, travel, and the like.

Everything you see is constantly changing as much as my life is. You'll find the repo for this site [here](https://github.com/juandpinto/juandpinto.github.io), and the repo for the Jekyll theme I use [here](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes).
