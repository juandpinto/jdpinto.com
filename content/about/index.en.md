Hi, I’m Juan! I love learning about anything and everything, trying out new things, and going on adventures. I’ve dabbled in many areas and hobbies over the years, acquiring a wide range of skills in areas like teaching, graphic design, foreign languages, [coding](https://github.com/juandpinto), editing, photography—you name it.

But first and foremost, I’m a family man 👨🏽👩🏼👦🏻👧🏻👶🏻🐱🐱. I’m also an educator passionate about the potential of effectively using technology to increase access to high-quality education around the world. This interest has brought me to the [DELTA](https://education.illinois.edu/ci/programs-degrees/delta) program at the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu), where I get to learn all about educational data science and its uses in designing digital learning environments.

I originally hail from the beautiful country of Colombia 🇨🇴---in case you're wondering which fútbol team I'll be rooting for. I've now spent most of my life in the United States, though I've done a good bit of traveling and love the diversity on this planet. When I'm not in front of a computer wrangling big datasets, you'll usually find me running around with my kids, riding 🚴🏽‍♂️ through the cornfields of central Illinois, or looking for birds 🦜 in a nearby park.
