# About Me

I'm currently living in Israel and working as a Fulbright English Teaching Assistant. I get to teach wonderful students, lead conversation groups, and help out at after-school programs with wild kids who have too much energy. I love it.

<br />

I recently received my Master's in Middle Eastern Languages and Culture (my emphasis being Hebrew Applied Linguistics) from the University of Texas at Austin. I'm applying to various Ph.D. programs right now, my research focus being the use of educational technology for second language acquisition. I'm fascinated by the prospect of using learning analytics to improve the effectiveness of computer assisted language learning.

<br />

I also consider myself an advocate of open science, open data, open source software, open educational resources, and everything in between. Research needs to be as accessible and reproducible as possible, and I do what I can in my own spheres of influence to further that aim. Similarly, furthering the goals of the open web—primarily through advocacy for and incorporation of [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org) protocols—is an important goal of mine. You can check out my personal open repositories, along with my latest projects, at [my GitHub account](https://github.com/juandpinto).

<br />

When I'm not working on my personal projects, sharpening my Python / statistical analysis skills, or reading the latest publications in the field, you'll usually find me spending quality time with my wife and two children.

# About this site

This site serves a central hub for the goings-on of my life. Primarily, I plan to use it so like-minded academics, educators, and internauts can contact me easily and learn more about my latest projects. I'm always looking for fellow collaborators, so feel free to [reach out](mailto: juan@juandpinto.com).

<br />

But aside from providing basic information about me, this site hosts my [blog](./blog/) and [microblog](https://microblog.juandpinto.com). These are the best places to read about my educational endeavors and my ramblings about adventures, travel, and the like.

<br />

Everything you see is constantly changing as much as my life is. You'll find the repo for this site [here](https://github.com/juandpinto/juandpinto.github.io), and the repo for the Jekyll theme I use [here](https://github.com/mmistakes/so-simple-theme).
