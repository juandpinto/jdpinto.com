Multiple moves across the country (and the world) have convinced me of the benefits of keeping my physical library to a minimum and instead relying heavily on ebooks. In my efforts to build up a digital library that my family can all enjoy, I've created an online portal to easily find, read, listen to, and download books from our family digital library from anywhere in the world.

Of course, due to copyright laws, I can't share this library publicly. A username and password is required to access our growing library of over 1,000 ebooks / audiobooks.
