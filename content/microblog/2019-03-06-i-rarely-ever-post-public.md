I rarely ever post public declarations of affection. But each day of the four years since I married this woman—and of the three years we dated before that—I have fallen more and more in love with her. I couldn’t have conjured a more wonderful companion in my wildest dreams. My imagination isn’t strong enough to dream so big. And yet, this is my incredible reality.
