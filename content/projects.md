# Academic Projects


## Explicit synthetic phonics for teaching reading to young EFL learners

I'm a junior researcher on this study being led by [Dr. Janina Kahn-Horwitz](https://www.oranim.ac.il/personal/janina_k/en/default.aspx) and [Hanny Fuks](https://www.oranim.ac.il/personal/hanny.fuks/en/default.aspx) of Oranim Academic College in Israel. This is an experimental design study that is trying to measure the effectiveness of a synthetic phonics approach to EFL reading education in elementary schools in Israel. We have gathered data from pre-tests and post-tests for an experimental and control group of fourth graders, and we are currently at the data analysis stage. We intend for this to be a multi-study project involving more schools after the results of this initial preliminary study are published.


## Peace Education in Colombia

I'm currently a graduate research assistant on a large, qualitative study being conducted by [Dr. Michelle Bellino](http://www.soe.umich.edu/people/profile/bellino_michelle/) of the University of Michigan. More information about this study can be found in [this news post](http://www.soe.umich.edu/news_events/news/article/michelle_bellino_receives_spencer_foundation_grant_for_work_on_peace_educat/), quoted at length here:

> As Colombia transitions from more than fifty years of internal armed conflict, how will educators engage with students around the complex causes and consequences of protracted violence, and the fragile transition to peace? Negotiating an end to the conflict has polarized society, raising questions about security, accountability for past violence, and the potential for far-left and far-right political ideologies to divide Colombia’s democracy. In contrast to other post-conflict settings, there is a strong national initiative and educational policy context for Colombia’s Cátedra de Paz, a cross-curricular effort to implement peace education, as peace processes continue to evolve.
>
> This study draws from a diverse sample of secondary schools in Bogotá to examine how teachers approach conversations about peace, conflict, and justice, as well as how they perceive school demographics and conflict legacies as enabling and constraining these interactions. Deepening our understanding of opportunities and challenges across classroom contexts will inform efforts to better support teachers and young learners in navigating difficult conversations. This study will have relevance to other post-conflict contexts, informing educational reforms, in addition to transitional justice decisions such as integration and resettlement policies that significantly impact the educational sector.


# Technical projects


## Pinto eLibrary

I've set up a digital library where I keep my family's growing collection of books. This includes everything from technical manuals and academic festschrifts to Great Lectures and fantasy novels (I'm particularly a fan of Brandon Sanderson). Check out my recent reads [here](/microblog/reads/)!

I keep this growing library organized with the wonderful open-source tool [Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com). I can't recommend it enough. For the web server, I use [calibre-web](https://github.com/janeczku/calibre-web) because I find it much more aesthetically pleasing and user friendly than the built-in Calibre Server. I host the server locally on a [Raspberry Pi 4](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/).

# Frequency Dictionary of Spoken Hebrew (FDOSH)

My MA thesis at the University of Texas at Austin was the creation of a frequency dictionary of spoken Hebrew. All of the scripts and data for the project can be found at the [project GitHub page](https://github.com/juandpinto/frequency-dictionary) or as supplementary materials at [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/1239886#.XAyLU6eB0Wo). The manuscript itself, written entirely in Markdown and LaTeX, has its own [GitHub repository](https://github.com/juandpinto/thesis-manuscript), but the final manuscript can be accessed directly [here](./docs/Pinto_MA_thesis.pdf).

Though my thesis is now complete, this project is ongoing as I work to optimize the code, simplify the process, conduct further statistical analyses, and publish my final results. The abstract for the thesis can be found below:

> Studies using word frequency dictionaries—on topics such as vocabulary acquisition, vocabulary load, extensive reading, and vocabulary testing—have historically centered around corpora and morphological issues specific to European languages, especially English. One of the reasons for this is the lack of resources that often plagues departments of less commonly taught languages. Corpora of spoken language are particularly difficult to obtain—the funding and time necessary often make such a project impossible.
>
> This thesis is an effort to provide some of the methodology and tools necessary for educators interested in creating frequency dictionaries for research purposes, for their own classrooms, or even for wider dissemination. In doing so, it will provide an overview of some of the key decisions that must be taken into account for such a project.
>
> Throughout this thesis, the creation process behind the *Frequency Dictionary of Spoken Hebrew* (FDOSH)—a list of the most common words in conversational Modern Hebrew—will be explained. The tools used to create the FDOSH, including corpus resources and customized scripts, are provided as part of a repository of supplementary materials. The goal is to make the entire dictionary-creation process as reproducible as possible while allowing for flexibility and transparency in the tools used. It does this by using well-documented open-source scripts written in an easily readable programming language, Python.
>
> Beyond providing these tools, the present project explores the theory and many of the considerations that play an important role in the creation of a frequency dictionary. These include issues such as corpus size, corpus text type, whether the list is intended for general or specialized use, word family levels, and objective criteria. Issues regarding Hebrew's synthetic morphology and ambiguous non-vocalized writing system are also addressed.
>
> The project aims to serve as a catalyst for future research that may build upon the ideas discussed here. The development and open dissemination of tools such as these can only lead to greater cooperation among educators and researchers, to the benefit of all involved.
