As part of my Fulbright Fellowship, I'm spending the 2018–2019 school-year as a Fulbright English Teaching Assistant at [Oranim Academic College of Education](http://www.oranim.ac.il/). My responsibilities are split between the International School and the Department of English Language and Literature.

<br />

# Office hours

My office is located on the bottom floor of building 58. Enter the International School and you will find me in a corner office behind the front desk.

<br />

I hold regular office hours at the following times:

<ul style="text-indent:40px;">
  <li>Sundays, 13:00–15:00</li>
  <li>Mondays, 10:00–12:00</li>
</ul>

<br />

If you would like to meet with me, you will find me in my office during these times. I prefer that you let me know beforehand that you are coming since I often have specific students scheduled in for these times. However, feel free to come by and see if I'm available.

<br />

If the above times don't work and you would like to meet outside my regular office hours, please send me an email at [jdpinto1@gmail.com](mailto:jdpinto1@gmail.com).
