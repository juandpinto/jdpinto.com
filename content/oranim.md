As part of my Fulbright Fellowship, I spent the 2018â€“2019 school-year as a Fulbright English Teaching Assistant at [Oranim Academic College of Education](http://www.oranim.ac.il/). My responsibilities were split between the International School and the Department of English Language and Literature.

For those involved with the **Masa English for the Workplace** program, you can find the resources page for the Conversation Club [*here*](/oranim/conversationclub/).
