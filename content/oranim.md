As part of my Fulbright Fellowship, I'm spending the 2018–2019 school-year as a Fulbright English Teaching Assistant at [Oranim Academic College of Education](http://www.oranim.ac.il/). My responsibilities are split between the International School and the Department of English Language and Literature.

<br />

For those involved with the **Masa English for the Workplace** program, you can find information on past and upcoming Conversation Clubs [*here*](/oranim/conversationclub/).

<br />

# Office hours

My office is located on the bottom floor of building 58. Enter the International School and you will find me in a corner office behind the front desk.

<br />

During the spring semester, I hold regular student office hours at the following times:

<ul style="text-indent:40px; list-style: circle inside;">
  <li>Mondays, 10:00–12:00</li>
  <li>Wednesdays, 13:00–15:00</li>
</ul>

<br />

If you would like to meet with me, please sign up for an available time slot below (or [here](https://calendly.com/juanpinto)).

<br />

If the available times don't work for you and you would like to meet outside my regular office hours, please send me an email at [jdpinto1@gmail.com](mailto:jdpinto1@gmail.com). I try to be accommodating but make no guarantees.
